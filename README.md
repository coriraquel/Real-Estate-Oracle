# Overview: 
The Real Estate Oracle project leverages machine learning techniques to predict housing prices based on various factors, such as location, size, amenities, and more. The goal is to build a model that can provide accurate predictions of house prices using historical real estate data. This project integrates advanced data processing, regression models, and evaluation metrics to predict housing prices and deliver insights to potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

# Problem Statement: 
The housing market can be complex and unpredictable, with many variables influencing property prices. The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast house prices based on factors such as:

Location (e.g., zip code, neighborhood)
Size (square footage)
Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
Year built
Lot size
Property type (single-family, condo, etc.)
By training the model on historical real estate data, the aim is to provide valuable insights for young homebuyers interested in informed decision-making.

# Learning Objectives: 
1. Efficient Data Processing: Use advanced techniques with Pandas to preprocess and clean large datasets.
2. Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features from raw data that will improve the predictive power of the model.
3. Machine Learning Models: Implement various regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict housing prices.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
5. Data Visualization: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize key features, model results, and insights.

# Technologies Used: 
Python: Primary language for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: For visualizing the dataset and results.
Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive development and exploration of the data.

# Learner Growth: 
This project has provided valuable experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets. The combination of regression models, data preprocessing, and visualization allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how machine learning can be used in the real estate domain. Iâ€™ve learned how to optimize models, visualize results, and interpret predictive outcomes effectively.

# Potential Questions: 
1. What features have the most impact on housing prices?
2. Can the model predict prices accurately for unseen data?
3. How does location influence pricing, and can the model predict prices in different cities?
4. What other machine learning models could be implemented to improve predictions?
5. How does feature scaling impact model accuracy?

# Timeline: 
This project was completed over five weeks. Week one consisted of data exploration and consumer research. Weeks two and three focused on cleaning and preprocessing the data to account for missing values and categorical encodings. Week four built, trained, and evaluated various machine learning models. Finally, week five focused on analyzing the results, creating visualizations and dashboard, and applying any model refinements based on the results. If including a written report on this project, weeks six and seven will focus on compiling those results into a paper.
